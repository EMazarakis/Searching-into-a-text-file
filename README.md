# Searching-text-file

## OVERVIEW - Batch Scripting 

Searching into the **search.log** file in order to find the pattern **_"Error line: "_**.

Then the script splits the results into 3 strings and returns the 3-rd one, which is a number.

All the numbers where the script finds they will be written to the **Results.txt** file.  

**Results.txt** & **search.log** will exist under the same directory.


## Set Up - Instructions
