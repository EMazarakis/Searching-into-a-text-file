# Searching-text-file

## Batch Scripting - Searching a text file and extract some data.  

Searching into the **search.log** file in order to find the pattern **"Error line: "**.

Then the script splits the results into 3 strings and returns the 3-rd.

All the numbers where the script found they were written to the *Results.txt* file.  

At the **digger_of_text_file.bat** you have to change the variable *where_searching_file_is*=**"dir-path-of-the-file-search.log"**.
